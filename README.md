# Flux

Flux—a new approach to solar energy generation—makes commercial solar readily deployable and easily scalable. Instead of relying on stationary solar panels, Flux uses self-driving rovers that can capture sunlight in parking lots. These rovers autonomously navigate the parking lot throughout the day to accommodate the movement of people and vehicles.
